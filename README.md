### Deep Dive: Achievement Module Structure

The `achievement/` module demonstrates our modular architecture approach:

```
achievement/
├── components/                    # React components for UI
│   ├── AchievementCardWidget.tsx     # Card display component
│   ├── AchievementDetailsWidget.tsx  # Detailed view component
│   ├── AchievementForm.tsx           # Creation/editing form
│   ├── AchievementMediaWidget.tsx    # Media management widget
│   ├── AchievementPictureWidget.tsx  # Full-screen image viewer
│   ├── AchievementListComponent.tsx  # List view component
│   └── index.ts                      # Component exports
├── hooks/                         # Custom React hooks
│   └── useAchievement.ts             # Achievement state management
├── models/                        # Data models and interfaces
├── screens/                       # Screen components for navigation
├── services/                      # API communication layer
│   ├── achievementService.ts         # HTTP service calls
│   ├── commands/                     # Command objects for API
│   └── responses/                    # Response type definitions
├── types/                         # TypeScript type definitions
└── validation/                    # Form validation schemas
```

**Architecture Benefits:**
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each folder has a specific responsibility
- **Reusability**: Components and hooks can be easily reused
- **Maintainability**: Clear organization makes code easy to navigate
- **Scalability**: New features can be added following the same pattern
- **Testing**: Isolated components are easier to unit test

## Architecture

### Modular Component Architecture

The application follows a **modular component-based architecture** with several key principles:

**1. Module-Based Organization**
- Each feature (achievement, skills, social) is organized in its own module
- Modules are self-contained with their own components, services, and types
- Cross-module dependencies are minimized and well-defined

**2. Component Hierarchy**
- **Widgets**: Reusable UI components (e.g., `AchievementCardWidget`)
- **Components**: Feature-specific components (e.g., `AchievementListComponent`)
- **Screens**: Full-screen components for navigation
- **Common Components**: Shared UI elements across modules

**3. Service Layer Pattern**
- API communications are abstracted into service classes
- Services handle HTTP requests, error handling, and data transformation
- Business logic is separated from UI components

**4. Custom Hooks Pattern**
- State management and side effects are encapsulated in custom hooks
- Hooks provide clean APIs for components to interact with data
- Promotes code reuse and testability

**Benefits:**
- **Maintainability**: Easy to locate and modify specific functionality
- **Scalability**: New features can be added without affecting existing code
- **Testability**: Components and services can be tested in isolation
- **Developer Experience**: Clear patterns make onboarding new developers easier
- **Code Reusability**: Components and hooks can be shared across features
